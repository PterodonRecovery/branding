[COLOR="red"]For moderators: THIS PROJECT ISN'T BASED ON TWRP[/COLOR]

Pterodon recovery is an android custom recovery developed by XDA member [URL="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=8393345"][COLOR="green"]ATG Droid[/COLOR][/URL], this project is just another attempt in bringing another custom recovery in to the android development scene. For some time this project is going to be closed source, so that the community gets to know it first and later it gets open sourced so that the whole community can contribute and develop something awesome out of this.

Remember that this project is in alpha development stage, which means that only few things are actually working, for example the main features which you would expect from a custom recovery are not even implemented yet, so the builds are right now only for testing.
